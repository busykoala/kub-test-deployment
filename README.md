# Kubernetes Test Deployment

This is a dummy deployment to learn kubernetes stuff.

## Startup

The setup commands require you to have kubernetes installed.
To get started k3s is pretty neat -> https://k3s.io/

```
git clone git@github.com:busykoala/kub-test-deployment.git
cd kub-test-deployment
kubectl apply -k .
```
